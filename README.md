### FORMULA 1 RACING 

## Objective


Formula 1 (F1 Racing) is one of the highest single-seater racing spaort games conducted in various seasons all over the world, known as the GRand Prix.The objective behind using this API towards my project is to present the data about these races to guide the users for getting the information based on certain queries like races conducted in a country, the driver's records, etc.
I am attempting to resolve the following questions in my project:

 1. Retriev the data for all the races conducted between the       
    selected years?

 2. To Calculate the number of races held in each country from during a period of time
         display this data?

## Motivation

I found this API interesting for my project, since the API format is simple and a very clear description has been documented, thus for someone who is using this concept of data incorporation in projects from the API, it is easily understanable.Also the API seems to be having a great scope in adding more functionalities once I will get a hands on experience with working on a small unit and learn new skills and updating my application.
